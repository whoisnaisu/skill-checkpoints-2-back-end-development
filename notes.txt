- req comes before res
- init node js first
- install nodemon
- install body parser
- if using Postgre, install pg and create pool to connect Node.js to the database
- not to go beyond the requirements (you aren't gonna need it)
- sleep well before working is important

- why do we need to put all express API in init() and make it async?
- what is cors? i can't remember them at all
- do we need to create a table on the PG itself or do it bt the postman?
- I think I have a problem with PostgreSQL...
